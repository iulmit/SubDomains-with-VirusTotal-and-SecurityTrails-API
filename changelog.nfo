bringing back example.cmd (it just calls index.cmd) since I have got used to it.

* ignore some warnings. normalizing input, handling empty or invalid response content as an error. only use pause when exit code is not zero (pause is not needed since the program runs the Notepad2.exe in sync and waits for it to end, where the console still is up).

* u (note: continue of process below)

* Notepad2.ini is generated in each execution of Notepad2.exe and does not contains meaningful information, so it is not needed.

2021.09.28.202215
* the vb6 exe acts weird when having an embedded manifest, so I've included the binary from https://github.com/eladkarako/CSharp-InputBox.git instead.

+ making sure not to include the actual API keys by mistake, by requiring user, for the first time usage to rename '.txt.example' files to just '.txt' and placing their actual API key inside, can be include an empty file for API_SECURITYTRAILS.txt for now since their API sucks so it is commented out.

2021.09.28.185350
+adding changelog notes and changelog file (changelog will not be updated with itself, since it creates a loop ;) - other than now which I'm pre-assuming date and time).

2021.09.28.184330
normalizing EOL characters to windows-eol. (note: it means adding a .gitattributes and fixing some existing EOL in some files).

2021.09.28.184126
not including debug content. (note: + adding .gitignore to ignore the debug text and json files, if action is uncommented in the code). 

2021.09.28.183953
normalize naming. (note: example.cmd to index.cmd)

- removed 'SUPER_DOMAINS' since I didn't used it anyway.
+ using generic workarounds to make sure the client always connects (even with certificate errors) - NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED, rejectUnauthorized-false, requestCert-false.
+ fixing logic bug: the protocol of the url is (now) properly-compared to either https or http.
+ adding (non-breaking) notes regarding missing entries in VirusTotal response json, that might be a change in the API.
+ reduce the error handling to minimal JSON.parse, including two debug text writing (commented-out) for response raw content (but really - JSON) and the parsed JSON.
+ the done_handler() was throwing errors due to @#$! 'highResolutionScrollingAware' and 'ultraHighResolutionScrollingAware' manifest entries which were not a problem in w7 but broke the exe in w10. so running Notepad2.exe returned error through 'spawnSync'.
* updating exes with proper manifest from https://github.com/manifest

2019.12.19.175149
* u (note: adding information regarding the API used)

2019.12.19.162749
* u (note: improved error handling, some code refactoring)

2019.10.11.104815
* fix in-case there are no entries in the response-JSON object from virustotal.

2019.10.01.220243
* making subdomains and sibling domains be semi-separated in the list, each one is sorted by itself, then joined to a \r\n separated-text with two-empty-lines-for-separation.

2019.09.05.223600
* writing the (sub)domains output into a text-file and opening it with Notepad2 (binary file included).

2019.08.31.144024
* adding a new way to easy paste domain text, joined subdomains and domain sibling content.

2019.08.23.205120
* better output.
